# About

EnronData.org is dedicated to the continued development and refinement of the Enron email dataset. The unique nature of the collection makes it an ideal dataset to focus on for further enhancement and refinement. Beyond email, EnronData.org seeks to extend the usefulness of the Enron dataset by working on directory load files, classification load files, search files, etc.

Below is a screenshot for the first version of EnronData.org, originally registered on `2008-12-12T23:18:06Z`. This site has now been migrated to GitHub and ReadTheDocs.
