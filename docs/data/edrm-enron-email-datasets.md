# EDRM Enron Email Dataset

[EDRM](http://edrm.net/) has provided 3 versions of the Enron Email Dataset, of which 1 is currently provided.

The two previous versions are no longer provided due to the presence of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) that remained in the dataset when the [Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC)](https://www.ferc.gov) released the Enron email data set on March 26, 2003. Since that time, advances in identifying PII have made it possible to cleanse the data of PII to better protect the identities of those Enron employees.

EDRM data sets include:

1. Currently available
  * [EDRM Enron v1 Data Set Cleansed of Private, Health and Financial Information](http://www.edrm.net/resources/data-sets/edrm-enron-email-data-set)
2. No longer available
  * EDRM Enron v1 Data Set
  * [EDRM Enron v2 Data Set](http://www.edrm.net/archives/8742)
