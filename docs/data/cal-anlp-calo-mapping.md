# UC Berkeley ANLP User Categorization to CALO Mapping

The [UC Berkeley ANLP](http://bailando.sims.berkeley.edu/enron_email.html) has performed user categorization of about 1700 emails from the CALO email data set. The information provided in the ANLP derivative data set is a subset of the CALO data set and has been reorganized.

This [UCB-ANLP to CALO mapping file](https://github.com/enrondata/enrondata/blob/master/data/misc/edrp_calo-ucb-anlp-map.txt) provides the information to associate the ANLP data with emails in the larger CALO dataset.
